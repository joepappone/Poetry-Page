            <h2>Dear Stephen</h2>
            <p>Dear Stephen... I've spent the better part of the last while searching for answers in the bottom of disposable coffee cups and empty promises made on the labels of energy drink cans. And of course I'm not gonna sue red bull for keeping me up. I keep myself up. And Stephen, I don't expect you to understand my joy when it comes to insomnia. But I've been into this shit ever since my body said, "fuck sanity gimme some profanity. Gimme illuminated street lights and long walks in the dark." I know I've been making excuses lately to go out at night for as long as I can, but if you promise to go to bed then I promise to make the effort to drive on my own. Stephen, I know you're worried that I've been smoking cigarettes lately, and my old addiction is a powerful supporter of your skepticism, but I already have breathing problems. And tobacco isn't something I can afford to intake. I miss the taste I'll admit. And god I miss the feeling. The penetration of my lungs and the soothing burn of the glowing tip. The thing about this is that I've come to realize not too many people can keep away from smoking. And it's harder to quit than you think. I've been smoking for awhile now and all I know is, Stephen, you should see what it does to me. There's a reason our lungs can only compress so much, as we can never get it all out of our system. And at this point I'd sell my left hand to never have to withdraw. I'd make any excuse I can muster to never have to breathe air again. So Stephen, don't expect an excuse when I tell you, I'm only held together by a pair of lungs that pump smoke. It's the only thing they know how to do. And the only thing I've been smoking lately, is you.</p>

            <h2>Strangers</h2>
            <p>Strangers. That's what we told ourselves we were. But this stranger you've become breaks down my door every time I see it in the hall. And I slow down. Subtly but noticeably, if you're looking. But lately you haven't been. And next time I might just stop completely. And just hold my breath until you notice me. But honestly I don't even know if you can hold your head high enough to not stare at the ground. And that's my fault in a way. And I'm sorry. My eyes desire a river to craft into an overwhelming tide. I love you. I'll try not to break stride.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>My Son</h2>
            <p>If I have a son, every morning I'm gonna explain to him that what he is to me, compared to a big bright warm dot in the sky is a pun, son. And I'm gonna explain that since I love puns and I'm comparing him to the sun, he too every morning must rise and shine. He too must encircle the world every single day he too must bring warmth within 150 million kilometers of where he goes. He too must bring light to every business trip, every conversation, every walk on the beach, every horrible cab ride. He too must make people wear sunglasses and try to block him out to seem cool. And I'll be the one telling them they're mistaking cool for cold. And if I have a sun, I'm gonna make him yell every day so that he knows his voice is always heard. I'm gonna make him watch the sunset every night and tell him that it's not true. The sun never truly sets. It's the world that blocks it out. "And that you, my son, must never let the world push you off until morning." I'll explain to him that he was the result of a passion the world can never match. And in that way, he holds more momentum behind his punches than the weight of the world. And when I see him diligently beating the grass, I'm gonna tell him to cut it off, he's gonna mess up all the world's frisbee trajectories. And when he skins his knee on the playground, I'm gonna start kicking the swingset and tell him that the ground and swing say sorry. And that they won't do it again. And when he had nightmares and starts worrying about monsters under his bed, I'm gonna come into his room with a flashlight and pretend it's a loaded shotgun. And I'm gonna call it the moster killer. I'm gonna roll around his room running into things and hitting my head on dressers and toys until he is completely encased in laughter. And when he is, I'm gonna kiss his forehead and tell him, " go to sleep, the monsters say sorry, and they won't do it again." And every time I call him son, I'm gonna smile. Not because I'm his father, but because that's my boy. And he kicks ass. And when the days come when kids are mean to him at school and he doesn't get to play with the cool kids, when he gets thrown to the ground with a skinned knee and monsters in his head, I'm gonna tell him to go to school the next day and start yelling that they really ought to meet your dad. Cause he'll make them say sorry. And they won't do it again.</p>

            <h2>Screaming Shotgun</h2>
            <p>And I just stood there, mouth wide open like a chamber for a calibre just large enough to refuse to fit through my teeth. White shards sprayed from my mouth as shotgun shrapnel, following the chunk of metal responsible. And my eyes, refusing to blink, strained tears as they rapidly moistened. This heartbroken face, so fear-stricken that it refuses to budge. I looked as though the contents of my wallet has just been spilled to the ground for the world to see. Like everyone saw the pathetic contents of my fridge and cabinets, or lack there of. Shards of sharp enamel represented old coffee punch cards, half-eaten bags of chips, three lousy crinkled dollar bills, condiments and expired condoms. Broken teeth and blurred eyes. And before I can even exert a noise, she looks away as if to God for what seems like years when I've lost track of time I stare at the ground, lifeless and defeated. Like I had just broken the holiest of creations, the definition of desire, the reason for being. And I, the vandalous I, humiliatingly overhear her conversating with her gossip companion, explaining how much of a mess I have become, how I can't chew so good with my chipped, cracked and crooked no longer "pearly whites", since those words slipped from my mouth. She replied, and I quote: "Yeah, but you should see his smile now."</p>

            <h2>Star Theory</h2>
            <p>I have this theory that you put the stars in the sky. That the wind was destined to howl your name and the clouds clear a path for you to run. That the grass hugs your feet as you walk across it and that thunder cracks when you hit me with that smirk. I held you and it felt like I've held you a thousand times before and still I pray for a million times more. You are my sober and you get me drunk on your lips. You are my calm and I your storm. I have this theory that God cast us both down on this earth and told us to find each other and throw the world off balance. I have this theory that God gives me a nod of consent when we're about to sin. Like it's okay to love you. And It's okay to let you love me. And when you ask me how I'm doing, I usually say "okay" and you say "just okay?" And I say "yeah." And it may not seem like much but okay is the best I've ever been when I'm away from you. And I don't use the term lightly. When I said okay I meant that there is peace in my mind somewhere amidst the constant panic and worry.  There is a part of me that knows God will never take you away from me. And this might be a little religious for me and I might be getting this whole God thing all wrong but goddamit I have this theory that the heavens bow to your glory and when you touch me I fly. And I don't ever wanna touch the ground. I have this theory that you put the stars in the sky. And stardust in my eyes.</p>

            <h2>Interesting</h2>
            <p>There was a madness to his eyes. Like a demon waiting to be freed inside him. He held his head like the third monkey on the bridge to Noah's ark as it was starting to rain. He smiled like a villain the moment before his plan was complete. He spoke calmly, as if knowing the answer before having asked the question. And he never shouted. Only whispered. As if his gaze allowed him complete dominance over the other. And it did. His face gave the impression he knew your deepest desires and how to achieve them. When you look at him, you can't help but feel slightly shorter. And a thousand times safer. His hands were like wrecking balls with the softest touch breaking down walls and stimulating skin. His kiss was addictive and seductive. As if going was the new drug and you were both gone. He walked with a conquering footstep, forcing submission into the ground before him. When he held you, your body couldn't help but beg. Your stomach grew fragile and your heartbeat raced. Or stopped. You could never really tell which. He picked you up like he just won the human race and you were his trophy. He is the most interesting man in the world. He doesn't always drink beer, but when he does, he prefers dos equis. Stay thirsty, my friends.</p>

            <h2>Skin</h2>
            <p>Skin...moves like the way a sparrow sings. And sometimes it stings. But not as often as I make myself think. I've touched tons of skin both fragile and formidable, rough and ribbon-like. I've touched calloused palms stained with war paint and I've touched skin that glides like butter being pushed around a knife. And skin tells you how to touch it if you listen. And all skins tell you how much pressure to apply whether they like sharp or soft fingertips. All skin wants to be touched. And your skin has been screaming lately. Telling me stories of where to go and whether to stop or go slow. Your skin whispers, "right there." As if there is the place goosebumps become speedbumps. Your skin is my psychedelic drug called going and one night we were both gone. And I've never been good at soft but I'm taking it slow gliding over your curves like I'm taking you for a test drive and your skin begs me to pop the clutch and hit the throttle but I go slow. Like a puppet master with my string growing short. But no matter how much you say, your skin tells me right here and right fucking now. So you lie here wearing nothing but my kiss and your lips disguised as a bargain bin and I'm looking for a deal. I hold you at the end of my string my fingertips ceasing movement at your hips whispering one thing in your ear...."beg me."</p>

            <h2>Gravity</h2>
            <p>I hate gravity. I hate it with all my strength. And with both of my feet. And when was 16 years old I was doubling the speed limit my best friend in the passenger seat blasting the music as loud as it could go. And I saw a ramp a ways ahead and I looked over to her and said "we're gonna fly". And she gripped the handle above her head with a passion I haven't seen come out of her for a long time and screamed, "I'm gonna die." That was my first lesson about gravity. About the way the earth bends just past the horizon and how no matter how fast I go I'll never catch a rainbow. But I'll still try. Because it's not about where you end up it's about how fucking awesome the road trip was. It's about drifting into your grave with a skinned knee and a mild concussion because we're all gonna rot in the ground anyway. My 16 year old self taught me how to live like the world was dying just as fast as we were. But the truth is it's gonna live forever. And this isn't a party story. This is a love story. Because just before I graduated from my 16 year old self I met a girl who got 6 days of "when I was your age" and 3 years of "we're not the right age". And when I finally looked myself in the mirror and said it's time to grow a beard and stop playing with expenses and laws, that was the day I put my heart in a cage and gave it to her but kept the key. Because I'm scared she might try to unlock it. And I can't afford for it to run away again. I'm sitting here torturing myself dying to feel those 2 seconds of airtime I'm killing myself trying not to fly. Because it's gravity that always pulls me down. And if you ask water she'll tell you Gravity, it's her savior. As for me I like the way fire ascends into the heavens. I like the way it burns you when you get close. I like how nobody pays attention to the blue. And it feels like a privilege to see it through and through. But like I said this is a love story. And we're only 17 years old. But if you look at her people say she looks like her mother. Gorgeous. And a smile that never fades. And when I look her through and through I can see her smile looks a lot like a pen. Writing her story just trying to make it to the next page. But if you ask me what she looks like I'll tell you she looks like toasted hazelnut on an autumn Sunday morning. She looks like the rain. She looks like I've been sleeping a lot more lately and for once I can hear myself think. Like, this world isn't really what I was looking for but I'd be happy to run away with her. Like she makes me want to stay. And she looks like a tattoo on my left forearm that matches her right. And she looks like my future. And if you ask me about my latest lesson on gravity it's that with some people it doesn't apply. Because when she's in the passenger seat of my sheet black camaro I hold her thigh. We cut the speed limit in half. I tell her we're better than water because with every ounce of my being I believe "we're gonna fly."</p>

            <h2>Hands</h2>
            <h3>By: Sarah Kay</h3>
            <p>People used to tell me that I had beautiful hands. Told me so often in fact that one day I started to believe them, until I asked my photographer father, ‘Hey daddy, could I be a hand model?’ To which he said ‘No way!’. I don’t remember the reason he gave me, and I would’ve been upset but there were far too many stuffed animals to hold, too many homework assignments to write, too many boys to wave at to, many years to grow.

                    We used to have a game, my dad and I, about holding hands. Coz we held hands everywhere. And every time either he or I would whisper a great big number to the other, pretending that we were keeping track of how many times we had held hands. That we were sure this one had to be eight million, two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-three.
                    
                    Hands learn more than minds do. Hands learn how to hold other hands. How to grip pencils and mould poetry. How to tickle pianos, and dribble a basketball and grip the handles of a bicycle. How to hold old people and touch babies. I love hands like I love people. They are the maps and compasses with which we navigate our way through life. Some people read palms to tell you your future, but I read hands to tell your past. Each scar makes a story worth telling. Each callused palm, each cracked knuckle is a missed punch or years in a factory.
                    
                    Now I’ve seen middle eastern hands clenched in middle eastern fists, pounding against each other like war drums. Each country sees their fists as warriors and others as enemies. Even if fists alone are only hands. But this is not about politics, no hands are not about politics.
                    
                    This is a poem about love, and fingers. Fingers interlock like a beautiful zipper of prayer. One time I grabbed my dad’s hand so that our fingers interlocked perfectly. But he changed position saying “No, that hand hold is for your mum!”
                    
                    Kids high-five, but grown ups shake hands. You need a firm handshake, but don’t hold on too tight, but don’t let go too soon, but don’t hold them for too long.
                    
                    But hands are not about politics. When did it become so complicated? I always thought it was so simple. The other day my Dad looked at my hands as if seeing them for the first time and with laughter behind his eyelids, and with all the seriousness a man of his humour could muster he said “You know you’ve got nice hands, you could’ve been a hand model!”
                    
                    And before the laughter can escape me i shake my head at him and squeeze his hand. Eight million, two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four.</p>

            <h2>Instructions for a Bad Day</h2>
            <h3>By: Shane Koyczan</h3>
            <p>There will be bad days. Be calm. Loosen your grip, opening each palm slowly now. Let go. Be confident. Know that now is only a moment, and that if today is as bad as it gets, understand that by tomorrow, today will have ended. Be gracious. Accept each extended hand offered, to pull you back from the somewhere you cannot escape. Be diligent. Scrape the gray sky clean. Realize every dark cloud is a smoke screen meant to blind us from the truth, and the truth is whether we see them or not - the sun and moon are still there and always there is light. Be forthright. Despite your instinct to say "it's alright, I'm okay" - be honest. Say how you feel without fear or guilt, have at times been felt by everyone - that pain is part of the human condition and that alone makes you a legion. We hungry underdogs, we risers with dawn, we dissmisser's of odds, we blesser's of on – we will station ourselves to the calm. We will hold ourselves to the steady, be ready player one. Life is going to come at you armed with hard times and tough choices, your voice is your weapon, your thoughts ammunition – there are no free extra men, be aware that as the instant now passes, it exists now as then. So be a mirror reflecting yourself back, and remembering the times when you thought all of this was too hard and you'd never make it through. Remember the times you could have pressed quit – but you hit continue. Be forgiving. Living with the burden of anger, is not living. Giving your focus to wrath will leave your entire self absent of what you need. Love and hate are beasts and the one that grows is the one you feed. Be persistent. Be the weed growing through the cracks in the cement, beautiful - because it doesn't know it's not supposed to grow there. Be resolute. Declare what you accept as true in a way that envisions the resolve with which you accept it. If you are having a good day, be considerate. A simple smile could be the first-aid kit that someone has been looking for. If you believe with absolute honesty that you are doing everything you can - do more. There will be bad days, Times when the world weighs on you for so long it leaves you looking for an easy way out. There will be moments when the drought of joy seems unending. Instances spent pretending that everything is alright when it clearly is not, check your blind spot. See that love is still there, be patient. Every nightmare has a beginning, but every bad day has an end. Ignore what others have called you. I am calling you friend. Make us comprehend the urgency of your crisis. Silence left to its own devices, breed's silence. So speak and be heard. One word after the next, express yourself and put your life in the context – if you find that no one is listening, be loud. Make noise. Stand in poise and be open. Hope in these situations is not enough and you will need someone to lean on. In the unlikely event that you have no one, look again. Everyone is blessed with the ability to listen. The deaf will hear you with their eyes. The blind will see you with their hands. Let your heart fill their news-stands, Let them read all about it. Admit to the bad days, the impossible nights. Listen to the insights of those who have been there, but come back. They will tell you; you can stack misery, you can pack disappear you can even wear your sorrow – but come tomorrow you must change your clothes. Everyone knows pain. We are not meant to carry it forever. We were never meant to hold it so closely, so be certain in the belief that what pain belongs to now will belong soon to then. That when someone asks you how was your day, realize that for some of us – it's the only way we know how to say, be calm. Loosen your grip, opening each palm, slowly now – let go.</p>

            <h2>Suicidal</h2>
            <p>All my friends are suicidal. Fewer of my friends have tried. And even fewer have scars. And even fewer have succeeded. But on a good day dressed as a bad day for some extra attention we erupt in laughter and the words slip out “ I wanna fucking kill myself” this phrase is not out of the ordinary for my group of people. In fact we're only half joking. And a bad day dressed like a worse day we aren't joking at all. I'm not lying. I wasn't on the losing end of a roasting session. My parents didnt get mad over the dishes. My girlfriend didnt make a big deal out of nothing. “I want to fucking kill myself” you always thought I was kidding because the words were dressed like a bad joke. There was no way. You've seen the scars but that was the past. You always laugh. The center of the world. Surrounded by people who love you. Always so angry whenever that phrase left my lips because your feelings weren't dressed but naked like you dropped your purse everyone saw the condoms and tampons spill out to the ground with the roll of cash from work the night before. Depressed. And everyone could see you wanted to fucking kill yourself. But you're gone now and I don't know if you've been looking but I miss you and I haven't been wearing too much clothing and I want to fucking kill myself.</p>

            <h2>My Darling Sara</h2>

            <p>My Darling Sara
                    Shane Koyzcan
                    The failing use of my right hand isn't actually the failing use of my right hand, it's just another way to tell the time. And I'm ticking, so I've been picking myself up at bars with a bottle in each hand. But I never give myself any play. I just make plans with myself for the day after next. By the time the sun swings back around into position I forget the context of why i asked myself out in the first place. Did I think I was gonna score? I let a stranger pour me one more.
                    
                    She says my name is Sara, doesn't take much more than that to start a relationship. My darling Sara, cleans rooms for a living. Giving her youth and beauty to dirt and dust, understands more than most that family is a foot you put forward first you must weather the worst together. But having never met her family, she places love above all else, then protest that I use "love" to freely in poems, and I really should just say what I mean. And I suppose what I mean most is that I'm trying. She's been buying me time on a maxed out credit card, arms scarred from selling her own blood to pay down the debt. Tells me she doesn't mind going broke so long as I can give her a little more sweat, she says try.
                    
                    So I do my best impression of a pen. And when every problem looks like a page, I commit ink to paper and the worth of the words that come out determines my wage. I've been making enough to pay her the complement of not quitting of not sitting when standing is required. She only ask that I put the effort in, and in return she's willing to pin a paper heart to her chest and do her best impression of a target. She says that effort is the Siamese twin of success. So when everyone else looks like a wrong answer, she says she'll settle for being my best guess.
                    
                    So we lie in bed like a mess that someone's been meaning to clean for the large part of a long while. We lie there like a pile of dirty laundry and how we'll ever come clean is beyond me so we don't. She says its supposed to be dirty. And if by the end you haven't hurt me then you didn't try.
                    
                    So I do my best impression of a surgeon going in cutting purple hearts out of my own. Use my veins like thread and have them sown to our skin like metals. Because when the bleeding stops and the dust settles all we have are our wounds to wear like decorations upon our chest.
                    
                    Sara does her best impression of a war, tells me not to count my pride among the casualties because maybe faith means never keeping score. She says theirs more to effort than to just switching gears, and in terms of what one should give in this life sweat holds more value than tears. 
                    
                    You have to try. And even though the failing use of my right hand means i'll never land a knockout punch in the first round, life is composed of sound and fury. And whatever noise is left in me will be twice as loud when I try, so I plug myself into the idea of going the distance and I amplify. 
                    
                    My Darling Sara, has a throat like a vase that sings her words in the bloom. She's got a voice like perfume, its been sticking to my clothes so everyone knows where I've been sleeping. She's been keeping me so close you could use my body for evidence. Pull her finger prints as proof that she's been on top so often shes starting to look like my roof. A real sexy roof, and she doesn't leak unless you count the crying. She does that sometimes, worries that shes just a backup plan.
                    
                    My darling Sara, I've lived long enough to know that too many choices can destroy a man. I will make no exodus, be around long enough to watch uncertainty bid us farewell, then echo our names into the crater cause by the impact when our lack of conviction fell. You've never had to sell me on the idea of absolute trustworthiness in another. The first and only time you met my mother, Mama said "I like the way she looks at you" and I echoed back that I liked it too. Eyes like recycle bin blue, Sara looks at broken things as if she can make them new. And more than a few times I caught her staring, caught her wearing a smile reserved for those busy making plans. Sara believes that distance is a fundamental that can be side stepped by a piece of string and two tin cans, and I remember when my tin can rang.
                    
                    They said "There's no family to speak of so love is next in line and there's not a lot of time but shes asking for her boyfriend."
                    
                    In the cab to the hospital I feel my heart bend as if bracing for impact. So I do my best impression of a man and face fact its supposed to hurt. A doctor does his best impression of the truth and spares me attempts to skirt around the issue, they cant stop the bleeding. 
                    
                    And the failing use of Sara's heart isn't actually the failing use of Sara's heart, it's just another way to tell the time.
                    
                    My darling Sara, I was holding your hand when you died and even thought the failing use of my right hand prevented me from feeling you leave, I tried.</p>

            <h2>Cigarette Daydreams</h2>
            <p>The steps feel cold through my clothing
                    The night sky is so beautiful but only because we only see the stars
                    This world is bullshit but I'm in love
                    Capturing the moment with that camera I bought a while back
                    The cigarette burns my lips as I watch the glowing tip slowly fade but brighten with every hit
                    Because if I don't come back for another one
                    It'll die
                    And I think that's beautiful
                    A cheap, inanimate object
                    And it needs me to survive
                    I think that's why I smoke
                    Because I don't care about the fact that each one kills me a little more
                    All I care about is the serenity of that glow as it illuminates in the dark showing me its true beauty
                    But the more it shows
                    The faster it fades
                    Because our desires often kill us
                    And this time it's me bringing you to life
                    As I slowly watch you die</p>

            <h2>Dangers of Submission</h2>
            <p>It’s like this.....I am giving you me. I am literally letting you have it. I am surrendering my mind, body, and soul. I am submitting to you completely. I am sitting here and bleeding my emotions through every single word. Im digging to my core for the rawest ore. The words are so hard to grasp it’s like being stuck under water and desperately needing to breathe. Stop running from me, I will chase you until my lungs collapse and my bones ache on fire. Stop i’m begging, so I can kneel with my head to your hand standing in front of me. I don't dare open my eyes for they cannot do justice to the masterpiece that lie before me. Do you see my heart in your hands. My soul escaping my body to be spent with you. My being following your every word. This is scandalous, so dangerous and I fear for my life. Chose the poison that will run from your lips carefully now.  My destiny lies ahead and you are the sun I wish to follow without question and opinion. This is my decision.  Don't leave dusted ruin and don't break my fragile hold. Please, I will do what i’m told.</p>

            <h2>Symbolism</h2>
            <p>I think symbolism is funny. Things that are different but show the same thing. Metaphors are silly.  She tattooed her name on my heart and god it hurt. But no one saw that. She shit on me and I continue to look for a symbol something like proof Permanent and in my skin.  But I can't keep trying to prove I love you especially since I don't anymore. I just don't want to let go but you left and Im holding on to nothing.  The pain in my heart you left doesn't hurt to often anymore just healing like that old tattoo and here's a raised glass. Just for you.</p>

            <h2>Chains</h2>
            <p>The ground is there but we don't feel it. There is air around us and we bathe in it. The sky is open and empty but still filled with our dreams. Possibilities and broken lies. Burned bridges and teary eyes. Your like a chain on my ankle holding me down but I'm so strong. I will fly.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Pieces</h2>
            <p>We are all a piece of each other. And we're all dead but we just don't know it yet. The timer resets each time we inhale. And one day you just might take my breath away.</p>
